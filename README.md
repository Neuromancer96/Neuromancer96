- 👋 Hi, I’m @Neuromancer96, 25yo student from Czech Republic.
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, SNES games, anime and fantasy & sci-fi books.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Django and other backend stuff.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something coded in pure Python (now); I am seeking some experience.
